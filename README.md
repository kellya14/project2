#Team 1 README file
This project includes 3 separate files: A Kickstart file(to be used on clients only), a LDAP script, and a NFS script.

The Client's Kickstart file can be booted from our Apache Server from Assignment 1 by using the command: linux ks=10.2.7.224/client-ks.cfg

The LDAP script can be run by using the command: ./install-ldap-server
The NFS script can be run by using the command: ./install-nfs-server

Feel free to use -h or -help before running either script if you forget the commands to run the scripts.
